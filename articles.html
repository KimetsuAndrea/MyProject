          <h2>Tennis Court</h2>
          <p>Intramurals Day on October 23rd brought me back to the tennis court, a sport that I haven't played in years. It felt amazing when I was able to play again, remembering the fun and friendly competition. Tennis is a great way to get a workout, improve my health, and connect with friends. This picture was taken at the CTU Tennis court. I'm excited to play again with them.</p>

          <h2>CTU Oval</h2>
          <p>Yesterday, I captured this picture at CTU Oval, a wonderful spot to spend some free time. The morning air is so breezy and refreshing, making it a perfect place to relax and enjoy the outdoors. The oval is a great place to unwind and soak up the fresh air. It's a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. I highly recommend visiting CTU Oval if you have some free time.</p>
