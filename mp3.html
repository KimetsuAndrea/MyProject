                        Hindi man araw-araw na nakangiti<br>
                        Ilang beses na rin tayong humihindi<br>

    <strong>Lyrics</strong><br>
                    <strong>[Verse 1: Zayn, Liam]</strong><br>
                    My hands, your hands, tied up like two ships<br>
                    Drifting, weightless, waves try to break it<br>
                    I'd do anything to save it<br>
                    Why is it so hard to save it?<br><br>

                    <strong>[Chorus: All & Harry]</strong><br>
                    I'm sorry if I say I need you<br>
                    But I don't care, I'm not scared of love<br>
                    'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker<br>
                    Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong<br>
                    That you make me strong?<br><br>

                    <strong>[Verse 2: Louis]</strong><br>
                    Think of how much love that's been wasted<br>
                    People always trying to escape it<br>
                    Move on to stop their heart breaking<br>
                    But there's nothing I'm running from<br>
                    You make me strong<br><br>

                    <strong>[Bridge: Zayn]</strong><br>
                    So, baby, hold on to my heart, oh<br>
                    Need you to keep me from fallin' apart<br>
                    I'll always hold on 'cause you make me strong<br><br>

                    <strong>[Chorus: Niall, All, Harry]</strong><br>
                    I'm sorry if I say I need you<br>
                    But I don't care, I'm not scared of love<br>
                    'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker<br>

<strong>Lyrics</strong><br>
 Who cares what the world's gonna say? <br>
'Cause you know they're gonna say it anyway <br>
(And I know and I know that) <br>
Who cares if they laugh at what we do? <br>
'Cause it's only me and you that know the truth <br>
(And I know and I know that) <br>
Middle finger to the sky <br>
They don't know 'bout you and I <br> 
We've been rollin' deeper than they'll ever know <br>
Even though I broke your heart <br>
No, that won't keep us apart, baby <br>
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up <br>
If you want my lovin', you got it <br>
Anytime you want it <br>
Baby, bring your body back to me <br>
They can call me foolish and stupid <br>
Don't know why I do this <br>
But baby, bring your body back to me <br>
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up <br>
(And I know and I know that) <br>
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up <br>
If you want my lovin', you got it <br>
Anytime you want it <br> 
Baby, bring your body back to me <br>
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up, giving you up <br>
I, I know, I know, I'm not giving you up <br>
(And I know and I know that)<br>
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up, giving you up <br>
Baby, bring your body back to me <br>
Who cares what the world's gonna think? <br>
'Cause you know they're gonna think it anyway <br>
(And I know and I know that) <br>
I love all the bad things that we do <br>
Shut your mouth and put your hands where I want you to <br>
(And I know and I know that)<br>
Middle finger to the sky <br>
They don't know 'bout you and I <br>
We've been rollin' deeper than they'll ever know <br>
Even though I broke your heart<br>
No, that won't keep us apart, baby<br>
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up<br>
If you want my lovin', you got it<br>
Anytime you want it<br>
Baby, bring your body back to me
They can call me foolish and stupid<br>
Don't know why I do this<br>
But, baby, bring your body back to me<br>
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up<br>

I know, I know, I'm not giving you up<br>

<strong>Lyrics</strong><br>
Wanna believe, wanna believe<br>
That you don't have a bad bone in your body<br>
But the bruises on your ego make you go wild, wild, wild, yeah<br>
Wanna believe, wanna believe<br>
That even when you're stone cold, you're sorry<br>
Tell me why you gotta be so out of your mind, yeah<br>
I know you're chokin' on your fears<br>
Already told you I'm right here<br>
I will stay by your side every night<br>
I don't know why you hide from the one<br>
And close your eyes to the one<br>
Mess up and lie to the one that you love<br>
When you know you can cry to the one<br>
Always confide in the one<br>
You can be kind to the one that you love<br>
Ah<br>
I know you need, I know you need<br>
The upper hand even when we aren't fighting<br>
'Cause in the past, you had to prepare every time, yeah<br>
Don't wanna leave, don't wanna leave<br>
But if you're gonna fight then do it for me<br>
I know you're built to love, but broken now, so just try, yeah<br>
I know you're chokin' on your fears<br>
Already told you, I'm right here<br>
I will stay by your side every night<br>
I don't know why you hide from the one<br>
And close your eyes to the one<br>
Mess up and lie to the one that you love<br>
When you know you can cry to the one<br>
Always confide in the one<br>
You can be kind to the one that you love<br>
Ah<br>
I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair<br>
Going sick in the head tryna get you there<br>
And I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair<br>
It's not fair<br>
I don't know why you hide from the one<br>
And close your eyes to the one<br>
Mess up and lie to the one that you love<br>
When you know you can cry to the one<br>
Always confide in the one<br>
You can be kind to the one that you love<br>
Ah<br>
Ah<br>
When you know you can cry to the one<br>
Always confide in the one<br>
You can be kind to the one that you love<br>

<strong>Lyrics</strong><br>
It started with a kiss on your mama's couch<br>
2012 was nothing serious<br>
I know we caught the feels, it got really real<br>
Too good to be true, I guess I thought you was, yeah<br>
Why did I run away, run away, run away?<br>
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything<br>
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late<br>
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah<br>
I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you<br>
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you<br>
Baby now, oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Cheating on you<br>
Baby now, oh-oh-oh<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you<br>
Thought I could get you back any time of day<br>
Shouldn't have been so cocky<br>
Shouldn't have did you wrong (woah, oh)<br>
And now I miss you bad, really, really bad<br>
Guess you don't know what you got until it's gone<br>
Why did I run away, run away, run away? (Run away)<br>
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything (everything)<br>
I know it's getting late, getting late, getting late (getting late)<br>
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah<br>
I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too (you said it too, baby)<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you (I'm cheating on you)<br>
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new (ooh)<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you<br>
Baby now, oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Cheating on you<br>
Baby now, oh-oh-oh<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you<br>
Baby, no<br>
There ain't no lips like your lips
And nobody else feels like this<br>
There's no moving on, I'll admit<br>
If you go away<br>
Yeah, ah<br>
I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you (I'm cheating on you)<br>
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new (found someone new)<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you (believe it, baby)<br>
Baby now, oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Cheating on you<br>
Baby now, oh-oh-oh<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you<br>
You said goodbye<br>
And you said goodbye <br>

                    Found you when your heart was broke<br>
                    I filled your cup until it overflowed<br>
                    Took it so far to keep you close (keep you close)<br>
                    I was afraid to leave you on your own<br>
                    I said I'd catch you if you fall<br>
                    And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)<br>
                    And then I got you off your knees<br>
                    Put you right back on your feet<br>
                    Just so you could take advantage of me<br>
                    Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there?<br>
                    Feeling so high but too far away to hold me<br>
                    You know I'm the one who put you up there<br>
                    Name in the sky<br>
                    Does it ever get lonely?<br>
                    Thinking you could live without me<br>

Magkalayong agwat, gagawin ang lahat<br>
Mapasa'yo lang ang pag-ibig na alay sa 'yo<br>
Ang awit na 'to ay awit ko sa 'yo<br>
Sana ay madama, magkabila man ang ating mundo<br>
Kahit nasa'n ka man, hindi ka papalitan<br>
Nag-iisa ka lang, kahit na langit ka at lupa 'ko<br>
Ang bituin ay aking dadamhin<br>
'Pag naiisip ka, sabay kayong nagniningning<br>
Dito ay umaga at d'yan ay gabi<br>
Ang oras natin ay magkasalungat<br>
Aking hapunan ay 'yong umagahan<br>
Ngunit kahit na ano'ng mangyari<br>
Balang araw ay makakapiling ka<br>
Hihintayin kita, kahit nasa'n ka pa<br>
'Di ako mawawala, kahit na may dumating pa<br>
Dito lang ako, iibig sa iyo<br>
Hangga't nand'yan ka pa, hangga't wala ka pang iba<br>
Dito ay umaga at d'yan ay gabi<br>
Ang oras natin ay magkasalungat<br>
Aking hapunan ay 'yong umagahan<br>
Ngunit kahit na ano'ng mangyari<br>
Balang araw ay makakapiling ka<br>
Dito ay umaga at d'yan ay gabi<br>
Ang oras natin ay magkasalungat<br>
Aking hapunan ay 'yong umagahan<br>
